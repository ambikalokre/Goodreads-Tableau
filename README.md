# Interactive Goodreads Books Analytics Dashboard
## Project Objective
•	Identify how book publication volume has changed over time.
•	Highlight the most prolific authors and publishers in the dataset.
•	Understand which languages dominate the catalog.
•	Reveal which titles attract the highest reader attention via rating counts and reviews.

## Process
•	Collected Goodreads book data, including title, author, publisher, publication date, language code, ratings, and reviews.
•	Cleaned and transformed the data by standardizing dates, handling missing values, and grouping metrics at author, publisher, and title levels.
•	Built Tableau worksheets for time-series (books by publication year), ranked bar charts (top authors, publishers, titles), and language distribution, then combined them into a unified dashboard with interactive filters.

## Project Insights
•	Book publications show a sharp rise from the late 20th century, with a noticeable spike in the 2000s–2010s, indicating rapid growth in publishing volume.
•	A small group of authors and publishers contributes a disproportionately high number of titles, showing strong concentration of output.
•	English-language books dominate the dataset, while other languages appear with significantly smaller volumes, reflecting language bias in available content.
•	Popular series titles accumulate very high rating counts compared with typical books, emphasizing the impact of franchises and well-known authors on reader engagement.

## Final Conclusion
The Tableau dashboard demonstrates that modern publishing has expanded rapidly, yet output and reader attention remain highly concentrated among a few languages, authors, publishers, and blockbuster titles. This visualization can guide publishers, authors, and marketers in understanding where the market is saturated, which creators and languages lead engagement, and where there may be opportunities to diversify catalogs and target under-served segments.
